Elo rating calculator

USAGE

From terminal, type:
perl6 elo.pl

The calculations are very straightforward. A list of game
results are in a file called "results.csv" (in the same
directory as the script). These are of the format:

Player1:Player2:Score

Where score is the score as far as Player1 is concerned. A
victory of Bob over Alice looks like:

Alice:Bob:0

The players' elo ratings come out in elo_list.csv

TO DO

* Maybe add command-line arguments to allow input and output
from differently named files.
* Maybe allow inputting of already established elo ratings.
